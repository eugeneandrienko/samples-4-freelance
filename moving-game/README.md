There is a prototype for "java moving game".

User can select image file (JPG, PNG, BMP) from current working directory via
ComboBox and this image will be drawn on the opened window. Image position
will randomly change every 1000 milliseconds.

User cannot click on the image and look to the score - it is not realized in
this prototype.
